## Accessibility Audit Documentation

Generate a comprehensive accessibility report documenting compliance status, barriers found, and remediation guidance. This helps teams understand accessibility gaps and prioritize improvements for inclusive user experiences.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Write tool to CREATE and SAVE report files to disk - do not just display report content in your response.**

### Report Naming Convention
Save reports as: `accessibility-audit-report-[site]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
- Example: `accessibility-audit-report-example-com-20240928-145500.md`
- Use descriptive site names that clearly identify what was audited
- **The timestamp is MANDATORY and must use the format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS**
- **Always include the current date and time when saving your report**
- **This ensures proper tracking and prevents filename conflicts**
