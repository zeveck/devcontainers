## Performance Analysis Documentation

Generate a comprehensive performance report documenting your findings and optimization recommendations. This helps teams understand current performance status and prioritize improvements.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Write tool to CREATE and SAVE report files to disk - do not just display report content in your response.**

### Report Naming Convention
Save reports as: `performance-report-[app]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
- Example: `performance-report-dashboard-20240928-145500.md`
- Use descriptive app names that clearly identify what was tested
- **The timestamp is MANDATORY and must use the format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS**
- **Always include the current date and time when saving your report**
- **This ensures proper tracking and prevents filename conflicts**

  if (metrics.lcp > budgets.lcp) failures.push('LCP exceeds budget');
  if (metrics.cls > budgets.cls) failures.push('CLS exceeds budget');
  if (metrics.inp > budgets.inp) failures.push('INP exceeds budget');

  if (failures.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Performance budget violations: ${failures.join(', ')}`);
  }
};
```
